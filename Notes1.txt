
## Step 1: Problem

* Customers are repeatedly calling for the same issues.
* Human agents spend time answering similar queries multiple times.
* No structured way of **capturing, refining, and reusing solutions**.

---

## Step 2: Solution Approach

### **Agent Helper 1.0**

1. **Intent Detection**

   * When a customer calls, the AI Agent Helper listens to the conversation.
   * It identifies the **main intent** (e.g., "Payment issue") and then the **sub-intent** (e.g., "UPI transaction failed").

2. **Knowledge Capture**

   * Past agent–customer interactions are stored at the **sub-intent level**.
   * Solutions provided by agents are recorded and ranked based on customer satisfaction.

3. **Solution Refinement**

   * AI analyzes the top solutions for each sub-intent.
   * Builds a **“primary solution” (Version 1)** that is reusable and optimized.

4. **Agent Assistance**

   * Next time a customer calls, the AI fetches this **ready-made solution**.
   * The human agent simply conveys it to the customer → faster resolution.

### **Agent Helper 2.0**

1. **Voice Automation**

   * Customer calls → AI itself handles the call (without human agent for repeated queries).
   * Detects intent & sub-intent automatically.

2. **Audio Solution Delivery**

   * Provides the **refined solution via voice**.

3. **Omni-channel Sharing**

   * Customer can request the same solution via **SMS, WhatsApp, or Email**.

4. **Continuous Improvement**

   * If customer feedback says "Not resolved", the system learns and refines Version 2.0 of the solution.

## Step 3: Example Flow

Let’s take your example:

**Customer Call**:

> "My UPI payment to electricity bill failed, but the money got debited."

**Agent Helper 1.0 flow:**

1. **Intent:** Payment Issue
2. **Sub-Intent:** UPI → Transaction Failed → Amount Debited, Not Refunded
3. **Knowledge Base Lookup:**

   * Finds solutions from past similar cases.
   * Most effective solution (from past customer satisfactions):

     * "Refund usually happens within 3–5 working days. If not, raise a complaint with txn ID."
4. **Agent View:** AI shows solution → Agent tells customer.

**Agent Helper 2.0 flow (future):**

* Customer calls → AI voice says:

  > "We identified your issue: UPI payment debited but not credited. Refund usually takes 3–5 working days. Do you want this solution sent via WhatsApp or SMS?"

* Customer selects → AI sends automatically.

✅ This way:

* **Repeated calls drop**
* **Agents are free** for complex issues
* **Customers get faster resolutions**
