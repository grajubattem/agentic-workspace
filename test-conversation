Agent (Jason P.):
Thank you for calling Verizon Wireless. My name is Jason. May I have your name, please?

Customer (Maria Thompson):
Hi, this is Maria Thompson.

Agent:
Hi Maria! How can I assist you today?

Customer:
I just checked my bill and noticed a $35 activation fee. I wasn’t told about this when I upgraded my phone. Why is that charge there?

Agent:
I completely understand your concern. Let me take a quick look at your account... One moment, please.
(Agent checks system)
Thanks for waiting. I see the activation fee was applied when you upgraded your device in-store on May 30th. That fee is standard for in-store upgrades.

Customer:
Oh, I didn’t realize that. I’ve been a Verizon customer for over 8 years — is there any way to waive it?

Agent:
I do see you’ve been with us for quite a while, and your payment history is excellent. I’ll go ahead and request a one-time courtesy waiver for the activation fee.

Customer:
That would be great. Thank you!

Agent:
You’re welcome! The $35 fee has been waived and will reflect as a credit on your next bill.

Customer:
Awesome, I appreciate that. Also, I’m thinking about upgrading to an iPhone 15 — do you have any trade-in deals right now?

Agent:
Yes! If you trade in an eligible device like your iPhone 12, you can get up to $830 off the iPhone 15 with select unlimited plans. I can email you the promotion details.

Customer:
Perfect, please send it to my email on file.

Agent:
Done. You should receive the email shortly. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer:
Nope, that’s all. Thanks for the help!

Agent:
You’re very welcome, Maria. Thank you for being a loyal Verizon customer. Have a great day!

Customer:
You too!
